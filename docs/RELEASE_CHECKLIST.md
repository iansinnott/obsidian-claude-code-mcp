## Notes

-   **Repository Name vs Plugin ID**: The repository is named `obsidian-claude-code-mcp` while the plugin ID is `claude-code-mcp`. This is intentional and clearly documented.
-   **Desktop Only**: This plugin requires desktop-specific features (WebSocket servers, terminal access) and is properly marked as desktop-only.
-   **External Dependencies**: The plugin bundles all necessary dependencies and doesn't require users to install additional software beyond Claude Code or Claude Desktop.
-   **Multiple Vaults**: The plugin supports multiple vaults by using different ports, with automatic conflict detection and resolution guidance.
