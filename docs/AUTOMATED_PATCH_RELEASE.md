# Automated Patch Release Process

This document describes the automated process for creating patch releases on GitHub. This process is only for patch releases (e.g., 1.1.6 â†’ 1.1.7). Minor and major releases should continue to be done manually.

## Prerequisites

- Clean git working directory (all changes committed)
- `gh` CLI tool installed and authenticated
- `bun` or `npm` installed

## Automated Process for Patch Releases

When creating a patch release, follow these steps:

### 1. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add <changed files>
git commit -m "fix: <description of fix>"
```

Use conventional commit messages:
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `feat:` for new features (though these should typically be minor releases)
- `docs:` for documentation updates
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### 2. Create Version and Tag

```bash
npm version patch
```

This single command will:
- Bump the patch version in `package.json`
- Run the `version` script which updates `manifest.json` and `versions.json`
- Create a git commit with the version bump
- Create a git tag for the new version

### 3. Build the Plugin

```bash
bun run build
```

This creates the production-ready `main.js` file.

### 4. Push to GitHub

```bash
git push && git push --tags
```

This pushes both the commits and the new version tag.

### 5. Create GitHub Release

```bash
gh release create <version> \
  --title "Release <version>" \
  --notes "<release notes>" \
  manifest.json main.js styles.css
```

Example with generated release notes:
```bash
gh release create 1.1.7 \
  --title "Release 1.1.7" \
  --notes "## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed server restart behavior during port configuration
- Improved settings UX for HTTP port configuration

### Technical

## Release Notes Template

```markdown

### Bug Fixes
- <list bug fixes>

### Improvements
- <list small improvements if any>

### Technical
- <list technical changes if relevant>

## Important Notes

- The release uploads three required files: `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `styles.css`
- Obsidian doesn't use 'v' prefix in tags (use `1.1.7` not `v1.1.7`)
- The npm version command handles all version file updates automatically
- Always test the plugin locally before creating a release

## When NOT to Use This Process

Do not use this automated process for:
- Minor releases (new features)
- Major releases (breaking changes)
- Pre-release versions
- Any release requiring special handling or extensive testing

For these cases, follow the manual release process in `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.
